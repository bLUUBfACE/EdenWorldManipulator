A tool for manipulating world files for Eden World Builder


OWN MANIPULATIONS

The easiest way to add your own manipulations is to add a function into the file Manipulations.cs. 
You write a function with the same pattern as the manipulations that still exist, and then you add your function into the Dictionary at the beginning of the class so your manipulation shows up in the GUI.
When I'm updating the program later, I will always make sure that all manipulations programmed like that will still work.
